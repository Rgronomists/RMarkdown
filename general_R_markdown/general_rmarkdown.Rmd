## Why R Markdown?  
* Need structured words to communicate your analyses and figures  
* Formatting is the worst      
* R Markdown helps you easily combine words, code, and figures  
* **Helps with reproducibility BIG TIME**

## What can R Markdown make?    
* Everything 

## Presentations  
* Like this one  

## Reports  
* HTML  
* PDF  
* even Word  

## Journal Articles  
* Mostly for Statistics journals  
* Any Ecology journals?

## Websites  
* [Static page](http://ranae.github.io/teaching_hour_blog) 
* [Whole site](https://amber.rbind.io/)  

## Books  
* [Bookdown](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)  

## What if I like formatting/am a perfectionist?  
* Free to make adjustments with LaTex, HTML, or CSS right in your document  
* Also free to make entire templates or themes

My favorite part about R Markdown is that I have no idea how it works.  

## There is a [very thorough book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) on R Markdown by Yihui Xie, J.J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund

##   

[Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/) is behind of most of what you can do with R Markdown

He is an ISU Alum and I hear he is awesome.  


## Notebooks  
* Notebooks are a low pressure way to get started with R Markdown.  
* Keep everything in one place and be ready to share it.  
* Works well with version control.  

Let's make a Notebook.  

## Here is some code you can copy and paste without going into GitHub  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(RCurl)

agdata <-read.csv("https://github.com/Ranae/AGRON_R4DS/blob/master/week_01/iowa_crop_history.csv")
```
