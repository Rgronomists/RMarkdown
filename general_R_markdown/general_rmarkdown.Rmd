## Websites

## What if I like formatting/am a perfectionist?  
* Free to make adjustments with LaTex, HTML, or CSS right in your document  
* Also free to make entire templates or themes

My favorite part about R Markdown is that I have no idea how it works.  

## There is a very thorough book on R Markdown by Yihui Xie, J.J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund
